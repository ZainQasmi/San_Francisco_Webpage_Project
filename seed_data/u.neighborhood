12|Presidio|Before there was San Francisco, there was the Presidio. First occupied by the Ohlone people for thousands of years, the Presidio was later a military post for two centuries under the flags of Spain, Mexico and finally the United States. Today, the Presidio is a national park and a National Historic Landmark District that welcomes more than five million visitors each year. On its grounds, you can hike 24 miles of trails, enjoy art and culture, eat at the city's largest outdoor picnic, and much more. You may know the Presidio as home to The Walt Disney Family Museum and many culinary delights, but that's certainly not all there is. Please explore what else you can do in the Presidio!:|/static/neighborhood_images/presidio.jpg
